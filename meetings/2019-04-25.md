## Six-Week Sprint
    - End date: 2019-05-02 (six weeks)
    - Sprint goals
        - One week away from the end of the sprint
        - Tide: Probably merging the Context PR is the only achievable goal, good progress in regards to session management though
        - Async book: Could finish the goals
        - Website goals seem to be done
        - Library ecosystem: Done as well
        - Preparing the next sprint: Some pre-thinking is needed ahead of the next meeting; formalize and communicate the project list on the agenda is also one important factor for next sprint
        - In addion we could have rough leads on each sub-project
        - Still need to update the discord channels and the [README](https://github.com/rustasync/team)
    - Yosh not attending 02/05 meeting

## Working Group Updates
    - Status updates
        - tide
            - Improved cookie support landed ([PR](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/pull/170))
                - Great example of how to use middleware and context extensions 
                - It extends Context with the ability to both read and write cookies
                - The middleware, after invoking the endpoint, then reads out the updated cookies and adds them to the response
                - Could code example to get familiar with Context and middleware
            - General very active in the last week, lots of discussions and new members
            - PR is coming up soon which does the crate split discussed last week
            - Need to workout a process for review and contribution, and when folks are allowed to merge
            - http-service: Returns now a future ([PR](https://github.com/rustasync/http-service/pull/21)), now we can work on this [issue](https://github.com/rustasync/http-service/pull/21) in tide
            - Breaking change to http-service-hyper that changes function signature (serve → run, serve_async → serve)
        - futures
            - futures_api is now stable in nightly
            - futures crate updated accordingly
            - expect a PR to put remaining  unstable features in futures crate behind a feature flag, so  that the crate can work on stable

            - Patched a bug where macros would fail
            - Quite popular, past 500 stars on GitHub
