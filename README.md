# Rust 2018 Networking Working Group

This repo is for coordinating the Rust Networking Working Group. 

- [Background on the 2018 working groups is here.][working-groups]

At the moment, this repo is primarily used for the [issue tracker], where we organize networking-related discussions. If you have a networking-related topic you'd like to raise, please feel free to open an issue!

# Goals

Our *preliminary* goals are to:

* Make async programming more ergonomic in Rust by improving the futures library and providing language support for async/await syntax.

* Provide a shared foundation for web frameworks in Rust by standardizing on an interface for middleware (like [Tower]) & encouraging frameworks to use it, as well as writing examples of that middleware.

* Provide extensive documentation about network programming in Rust.

However, the WG is just getting started, and we want to hear from you about the scope you'd like to see!
